This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in C++ when accessing elements of a `std::vector`. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the vector's bounds.
